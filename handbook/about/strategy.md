# Openline Strategy Overview

## It all starts with our Mission
Our mission is to become the #1 customer data platform in the world by 2030.

The key word here is "platform".  

> A platform is a group of technologies that are used as a base upon which other applications, processes or technologies are developed.

A platform is not a pipeline.  It's not analytics.  It's an enabler for new and different technologies to flurish.

## We are a customer data platform

- customerOS is the system of record for all customer data within the business.  Yes it's a customer data warehouse.  But it's also a development platform.  It's a live, transactional system that interfaces directly with applications.

- We also provide components (like web forms and web chat) that make it easy for developers to interact with their customer data from within their applications.

Bottom line:  Developers build things with Openline.  It's our job to make it easy for developers to create, enrich, and extract value from customer data.

## Our super secret master plan

- Become the system of record for customer data within the business.
- Provide developers the tools to build their own workflows, applications, and customer experiences over the top of their customer data.
- Build an application ecosystem that allows any developer to build models and applications for any other Openline user to run or consume.
