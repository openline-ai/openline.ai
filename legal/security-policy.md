# Security Policy

At Openline, we are committed to ensuring the security and protection of our customers' data. This security policy outlines the measures and practices we have in place to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our SaaS platform and the data entrusted to us. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors associated with Openline.

For users of Openline's hosted products, Openline's Security and Privacy teams establish policies and controls, monitor compliance with those controls, and prove our security and compliance to third-party auditors.

## Information Security Governance

Our designated security officer is responsible for overseeing and coordinating all security-related activities. This includes making sure that the company is continuously focusing on our security through undertaking risk assessments, incident response, policy enforcement, and security awareness training.

3. **Employees**: All employees are responsible for adhering to the security policies and practices outlined in our internal security policies. They must report any security concerns or incidents promptly so that the company is able to respond appropriately to every concern and incident.

### Account Management

1. **Account Creation**: Employee and contractor user accounts are created with unique identifiers and are associated with a valid email address. Accounts are created only for authorized personnel.

2. **Account Termination**: When an employee or contractor leaves Openline or no longer requires access to our platforms, their accounts are promptly terminated to prevent unauthorized access.
