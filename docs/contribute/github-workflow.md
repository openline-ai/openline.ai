## Clone the repo

First, create a local copy (i.e. clone) of the source code that you'd like to work on.  The Openline CLI makes this super easy.  In your terminal, simply enter

```shell
openline dev clone <openline-app>
```

where "openline-app" is the name of the application you'd like to work on.  Examples include customer-os, contacts, or oasis.

You can enter `openline dev clone --help` to see all available applications open to community pull requests.

## Fork the repo on GitHub to your personal account

After you've successfully cloned an Openline application to your local machine, you'll see an output message that looks like this:

```terminal
ðŸ¦¦  a local copy of the codebase has been created.  Enjoy!
