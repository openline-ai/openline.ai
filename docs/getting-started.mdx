:::caution work in progress

We're busy building, and this is one of those things that is a work in progress!

:::

This guide will get you up and running with Openline in **less than 5 minutes**.  

## The Openline CLI

The easiest way to get started with Openline is by downloading and installing the Openline Command Line Interface (CLI).  The Openline CLI is a NodeJS app that makes it easy to setup and manage Openline apps directly from the terminal.  It's an essential part of using Openline.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js][node] version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

- [Git CLI][git]
- [First time Git setup][git-setup]

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

### Install the Openline CLI

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS" default>

```shell
brew install openline-ai/openline
```
  
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="linux" default>
    

```shell
curl -sSL https://openline.dev/cli-linux | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin
```
 
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can check that the Openline CLI is installed by running:

```shell
openline --version
```

## Starting up Openline customerOS on your local machine

Open your terminal and enter:

```shell
openline dev start
```

This will spin up customerOS locally via Docker and Minikube.  The customerOS server will be available on port `8081`.

### Health check

To verify that everything has been installed correctly and customerOS is ready to accept requests, enter the command:

```shell
openline ping
```

### Start building!

That's it, you are ready to start building with Openline!
