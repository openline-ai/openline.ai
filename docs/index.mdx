This guide will get you up and running with Openline in **less than 5 minutes**.  

## The Openline CLI

The easiest way to get started with Openline is by downloading and installing the Openline Command Line Interface (CLI).  The Openline CLI is a NodeJS app that makes it easy to setup and manage Openline apps directly from the terminal.  It's an essential part of using Openline.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js][node] version 16.14 or above

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

### Install the Openline CLI

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS" default>

```shell
npm i openline -g
```
  
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can check that the Openline CLI is installed by running:

```shell
openline --version
```
If everything has been installed correctly, you'll see an output that looks like `openline/x.y.z`

## Starting up Openline customerOS on your local machine

Open your terminal and enter:

```shell
openline dev start
```

This will spin up the customerOS dev server locally.

### Health check

To verify that everything has been installed correctly and customerOS is ready to accept requests, enter the command:

```shell
openline dev ping
```

### Start building!

That's it, you are ready to start building with Openline!
