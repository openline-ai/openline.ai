# Expressions of Interest

We are looking for fun, talented technologists (and humans) with a passion for the latest technologies, including AI, to join our team.
You will be working with one of the most creative and passionate teams, all focused on completely changing the way people interact and work.
While we aren't actively hiring right now, we want to get to know you if you can't help but get excited reading what we're up to.

## Requirements

- You've got some serious problem-solving skills up your sleeve, and attention to detail is your middle name...s. Plus, you're a pro at working independently or collaborating seamlessly with a team.
- Communication? Oh, you've got that covered too! You're a master at expressing your brilliant ideas and collaborating with remote teams.
- Most importantly, you're bursting with eagerness to help us revolutionize the way people interact with machines. We're talking about changing the game here, folks!

## Got what it takes?

If you think we're the missing puzzle piece in your tech adventure, then we're dying to hear from you! Seriously, we can't wait.

If our mission makes your heart skip a beat, go ahead and [send us a note][application] explaining why you're the one we've been waiting for. We're about to embark on a massive undertaking, and we'd love to have you on board!

Or hey, maybe you're more of a "let's dip our toes in the water" kind of person. In that case, why not join our Slack channel? It's the perfect place to start getting to know us and see if we're a match made in tech heaven.
