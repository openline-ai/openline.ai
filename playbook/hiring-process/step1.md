# The Openline Team Handbook

The Openline handbook is a public artifact that defines why we exist and how we work.  Born out of the open source community, open source principles influence how we build consensus and document our outcomes.  Open is a principle that extends far beyond our name.

With the handbook, we attempt to:
- recruit people who share our values and goals
- onboard new employees in a seamless and transparent manner
- allow potential partners, customers, and communities to better understand who we are and how we will conduct our business
- hold ourselves accountable to clear, transparent principles

As a distributed organization, the better our communication, the better our eventual outcome.  Open, transparent communication is a pre-requisite to everything we do.  As such, the Openline handbook is the central repository for how we run the company.

Anyone can submit a pull request to suggest updates or enhancements to this handbook through the [Openline repo](https://github.com/openline-ai/openline-website).
