We've all been there. 

- An Account Manager, unaware of several open support tickets, joins a customer meeting hoping to upsell. Instead, they spend the whole hour discussing unresolved issues. They end up looking foolish and waste an opportunity to build customer trust.

- The Marketing team launches a campaign without checking the status of open support items. The customer, frustrated with the open issues, isn't in a buying posture.  The campaign is ignored, or worse, the customer's frustration escalates at the prospects of being upsold when they're not happy with the current solution.
