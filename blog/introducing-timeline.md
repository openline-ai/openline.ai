Are you tired of spending hours searching for customer information? You're not alone!

Many fast-growing companies struggle to know their customers well enough as customer information is typically fragmented across different teams. Research from McKinsey & Company shows that [customer teams spend 20-30% of their time looking for information][mckinsey], leading to confused customers and poor experiences.

## The problem: fragmented customer information

With sales, marketing, customer success, and support teams holding different pieces of customer information, it's difficult to provide personalized experiences. This fragmentation impacts customer satisfaction, which [decreases by 13% for every additional minute a customer service representative spends searching for information][hbr].

## The solution:  Timeline

This is why we’re thrilled to introduce Timeline, a revolutionary tool that puts the entire history of your customer relationship at your fingertips.  This allows fast-growing teams to:

- **Solve customer problems on-the-spot**, as they understand the full context behind the issue.
- **Personalize the customer experience** by using their recent interactions with the company to guide the next best action.
- **Iterate faster** on building and delivering the solutions that customers actually need.
