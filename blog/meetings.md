Let's talk about Meetings.

Customer meetings are at the heart of every organization.  Whether in-person or virtual, these meetings are essential for building relationships, gathering feedback, and uncovering new business opportunities.  But to extract the most out of your meetings requires planning, diligent note taking, and a way to share the meeting content with team members across the organization.

Today meetings belong to the people who call them. The invitations, the agenda, the minutes, they live wherever the host decides to put them. And if the host didn’t share them with you, good luck finding them later. 

That’s. Not. Right. 

Customers belong to the business, and the meetings we hold with them are a key business asset.

That’s where Meetings comes in!

Meetings is a deceptively simple tool that gives you a single, centralized location to collaborate, plan, and extract intelligence from your customer meetings.  With Meetings, you’ll be able to:

- Enhance your customer service by having access to a complete history of all customer conversations across the business, allowing you to personalize your interactions and solve problems faster.

- Improve internal communication and collaboration by sharing meeting notes and key takeaways across different teams and departments, ensuring everyone stays informed and on the same page.

- Automatically extract action items and follow up discussion topics so you always follow through on your commitments.
